# easy-farming
Computer vision based disease detection in plants for easy farming.

In this repository we have two collabs one for training leaf detection collab and disease detection collab.

We detect four types of diseases: Blight, Mosaic Virus, Yellow Virus, Bacterial Spot.

1. Plant disease detection: https://github.com/soujanyanayak/easy-farming/blob/main/GCE_plant_disease.ipynb
2. Plant leaf detection: https://github.com/soujanyanayak/easy-farming/blob/main/leaf_detection.ipynb

The collabs were executed on GPU runtime connecting to Google cloud engine.
